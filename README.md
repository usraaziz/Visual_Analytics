# A Visual Exploration of Shakespearean Plays
In this research project, we focus on applying text analysis to Shakespearean plays by using a visual method. We were able to identify key information about Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet such as the importance of the characters, pivotal moments and the themes of the plays using human reasoning and various techniques such as sentiment analysis and social network analysis. From our findings, we concluded that we cannot rely on the share of dialogue alone to investigate the character importance we also need to implement a character network graph, which proved to gain more insights into the plays. Also, we used sentiment analysis to derive pivotal moments within the plays and to derive the themes of the plays. We faced an issue as the data was only dialogue. Due to this, we were unable to combine sentiment analysis with the key characters to reveal their emotional arc throughout the plays.
